Deep Learning Processing Library for Biological Data

# Setup

## Python

install the latest deepbiop version with:

```bash
pip install deepbiop
```

## Rust

You can take latest release from `crates.io`, or if you want to use the latest features / performance improvements point to the `main` branch of this repo.

```bash
cargo add deepbiop --features fq
```

Each enabled feature can then be imported by its re-exported name, e.g.,

```rust
use deepbiop::fastq;
```

### CLI

```bash
cargo install deepbiop-cli
dbp -h
```
