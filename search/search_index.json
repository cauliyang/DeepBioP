Follow the steps below to release a new version.</p> <p>Start by bumping the version number in the source code:</p> <ol> <li>Check the releases page on GitHub and find the appropriate draft release. Note the version number associated with this release.</li> <li>Make sure your fork is up-to-date with the latest version of the main Polars repository, and create a new branch.</li> <li> <p>Bump the version number.</p> </li> <li> <p>Rust: Update the version number in all <code>Cargo.toml</code> files in the <code>polars</code> directory and subdirectories. You'll probably want to use some search/replace strategy, as there are quite a few crates that need to be updated.</p> </li> <li> <p>Python: Update the version number in <code>py-polars/Cargo.toml</code> to match the version of the draft release.</p> </li> <li> <p>From the <code>py-polars</code> directory, run <code>make build</code> to generate a new <code>Cargo.lock</code> file.</p> </li> <li>Create a new commit with all files added. The name of the commit should follow the format <code>release(&lt;language&gt;): &lt;Language&gt; Polars &lt;version-number&gt;</code>. For example: <code>release(python): Python Polars 0.16.1</code></li> <li>Push your branch and open a new pull request to the <code>main</code> branch of the main Polars repository.</li> <li>Wait for the GitHub Actions checks to pass, then squash and merge your pull request.</li> </ol> <p>Directly after merging your pull request, release the new version:</p> <ol> <li>Go to the release workflow (Python/Rust), click Run workflow in the top right, and click the green button. This will trigger the workflow, which will build all release artifacts and publish them.</li> <li>Wait for the workflow to finish, then check crates.io/PyPI/GitHub to verify that the new Polars release is now available.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"development/contributing/#troubleshooting","title":"Troubleshooting","text":"<p>It may happen that one or multiple release jobs fail.

This is addressed by caching the Rust build artifacts.</p> <p>However, since GitHub Actions does not allow sharing caches between feature branches, we need to run the workflows on the main branch as well - at least the part that builds the Rust cache. This leads to many workflows that trigger both on pull request AND on push to the main branch, with individual steps of jobs enabled or disabled based on the branch it runs on.</p> <p>Care must also be taken not to exceed the maximum cache space of 10Gb allotted to open source GitHub repositories. Hence we do not do any caching on feature branches - we always use the cache available from the main branch.
